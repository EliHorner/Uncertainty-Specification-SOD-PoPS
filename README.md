# Uncertainty Specification for SOD PoPS

This repository hosts all of the files needed to run PoPS for a SOD casestudy in Southwestern Oregon,
along with files to fully specify (quantify, propagate, and partition) uncertainty in the model. Two methods of uncertainty partitioning are used, the simulation/Dietze method and the Sobol' method.
